# GameHub
The goal of this application is to provide one common location to access all installed games: from Steam, Origin, etc.

Some planned features include:

- Cross-Platform support
- Intuitive UI
- Keyboard Shortcuts
- Accounts with internet connectivity to see what other friends are playing
- Dark mode :-)
